The format of the INI file is divided into three parts:
1. Road parameters: Road (Road_Length, Road_Width, SignalPos, Road_id)
2. Vehicle parameters: Vehicle Type (len, wid, max_vel, max_acc )
3. Simulate: each simullate runs the simulation for 1 s no. of pass time period specified.

Additionally, we have followed the Indian Road Traffic System.
Assumptions:
1.The fastest vehicle tries to get to the rightmost lane.
2.Every vehicle tries to start from the leftmost position.
3.Overtaking will only take place from the right.

In openGL we are translating the vehicle type using a loop in accordance with the vehicles position and velocity.
